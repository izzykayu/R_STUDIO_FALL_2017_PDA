This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# classwork with class examples
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# Classwork: Assign the string hello world to object h and print the result.

seq(from=1, to=10)    # arguments inside, this will give in integers the 1 to 10
```
```{r}
?seq()

# Classwork: Consider the seq function. What does it do? 
# Generate regular sequences. seq is a standard generic with a default method. seq.int is a primitive which can be much faster but has a few restrictions. seq_along and seq_len are very fast primitives for two common cases.
```

```{r}
x <- c(12, 20.1, 53.6, 2, 7.43, 24, 8.2, 6)

```{r}
  # Create a numeric vector
  v <- c(2,15,5,7)
  # Create a naming vector
  n <- c("two","fifteen","five","seven")
  # Assign the names to the vector
  names(v) <- n
  v

  
```

```{r}
# Classwork: What happens if you type names(n) <- v?

names(n) <- v
n
# the numbers become the naming vactors

# What if the length of either vectors (names or values) are not the same?
p <- c(1, 2, 11, 21)
q <- c("a", "b", "c")
names(p) <- q
p
# you have <NA> for 21

```

```{r}

# What happens if you label two numbers with the same name? 
a <- c(8, 1, 2, 5)
b <- c("apples", "oranges", "mangos", "oranges")
names(a) <- b
a
# there is no error, see below
```

```{r}
# subsetting by index
v[c(1,2)]

# Subsetting by name
v[c("two","seven")]

  # Subset all but some
v[-c(1,2)]

  # Subset using logicals
v[c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)]
```
```{r}
# Classwork:
# What happens if you swap the index?
v[c(2,1)]
# the output will be swapped with fifteen /15 coming out first
# What happens if you subset by the name not present, like v[c("two","three")]?
v[c("two","three")]
# it will provide another index and value as <NA> and NA

# Does the “subseting some”" operation work with names? NO
# v[-c("two","three")]
# this will cause the following error: Error in -c("two", "seven") : invalid argument to unary operator

```

lv = c(1:10)
lv    #vector of numbers 1 through 10
L = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

# in this situation, numbers 1, 3, 5 are considered false, the logic repeats and therefore numbers 6, 8, and 10 are also false and thus excluded
f = c(TRUE, FALSE)
lv[f]
# in this situation, the number at position 1 is considered true and included, the number at position 2 is considered false and the pattern repeats (recycles) until there are no more values to be considered
```

```{r}
# Classwork: Make a vector of length 55 with NA in them and test for missing values using the is.na() function.
x <- NA
length(x) = 20
p <-c(1:15)
op <-c(x, p, x)
op   # op is the vector with multiple NA as well as number values

is.na(op)   # this shows where there is NA values
```

```{r}

# Extend this to a vector of length 50005000. 
extop <- op[1:50005000]

```
```{r}
